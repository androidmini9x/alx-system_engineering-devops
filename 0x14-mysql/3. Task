To create a new user named `replica_user` on the primary MySQL server (`web-01`) with appropriate replication permissions, and grant `holberton_user` SELECT privileges on the `mysql.user` table, you can follow these steps:

1. Create the `replica_user` with the desired password (replace `REPLICA_USER_PASSWORD` with your desired password):
   ```sql
   CREATE USER 'replica_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'REPLICA_USER_PASSWORD';
   ```

2. Grant replication-related privileges to the `replica_user`:
   ```sql
   GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'replica_user'@'%';
   ```

3. Flush the privileges to apply the changes:
   ```sql
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```

4. Grant `SELECT` privileges on the `mysql.user` table to `holberton_user`:
   ```sql
   GRANT SELECT ON mysql.user TO 'holberton_user'@'localhost';
   ```
